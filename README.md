# Merchant Control
Have merchants? Tired manual restocking them between sessions?
Merchant Control saves templates for every NPC, which tables and conditions were used.
Now you can refill them from the same sources in just one click.

# How to use
You need to create the "Merchants" folder for your roll tables.
Or choose another name and change it in the settings.
Next, select your merchant, add a couple of tables with counts, and press "Apply."

Please, make sure, that all your tables are resetted before you start using this module!
